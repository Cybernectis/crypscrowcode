# PostCSS Runner Guidelines

A PostCSS runner is a tool that processes CSS through a user-defined list
of plugins; for example, [`postcss-cli`] or [`gulp‑postcss`].
These rules are mandatory for any such runners.

For single-plugin tools, like [`gulp-autoprefixer`],
these rules are not mandatory but are highly recommended.

## 1. API

### 1.1. Accept functions in plugin parameters

If your runner uses a config file, it must be written in JavaScript, so that
it can support plugins which accept a function, such as [`postcss-assets`]:

```js
module.exports = [
    require('postcss-assets')({
        cachebuster: function (file) {
            return fs.statSync(file).mtime.getTime().toString(16);
        }
    })
];
```
