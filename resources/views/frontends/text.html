                        <h3 class="left">Trades of bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero</h3>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>The parties of a trade are referred to as "buyers" (those who are willing to trade local currency for bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero) and "sellers" (those who are willing to trade bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero for local currency).</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>When trading with a user located with the aid of crypscrow.com's services, payment instructions can only be communicated directly between the buyer and seller. We do not have any bank accounts that hold users' funds, nor do we facilitate or escrow any payments between buyers and sellers. At no point during the course of a trade does the buyers' or sellers' bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero enter our control.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Trades are conducted via the blockchain distributed computing network of the crypto currencies i.e. of bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero, which we cannot and do not control. When a seller sends bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero to a buyer during the course of a trade, the seller transfers bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero directly to a decentralized application (a "smart contract") and those bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero are inaccessible by crypscrow.com without explicit digital permission from the buyer or seller. It is impossible for us to have bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero directed to anyone other than the seller or the buyer as per the code of the distributed smart contract.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>If a dispute arises during the course of a trade, the buyers and sellers can work with a trusted third party to resolve where bitcoin, litecoin, dodgecoin, ether, ripple, zcash, dash, monero is allocated.</p>

                        <p>All communication made between buyers and sellers on crypscrow.com is end-to-end encrypted. No third parties, including us, have the technical ability to decipher and/or read these messages.</p>

                        <p>It is the responsibility of the users to make and keep adequate records of communications and financial history to the extent that they are required to do so in their jurisdiction. It is your sole responsibility to ensure you are complying with all of the record-keeping requirements in your local jurisdiction, which may include (but is not limited to) creating and storing copies of communications and details of transactions.</p>
